# Product Requirements Document: Storzy

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** December 2024
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Storzy is an e-commerce demonstration application designed to provide a realistic online shopping experience for testing and educational purposes. The application enables users to browse products, manage a shopping cart, and complete a full checkout flow.

**Vision:** Deliver a lightweight, fully-functional e-commerce frontend that serves as an ideal testing ground for Felan's QA workflows and other testing tools.

**Key Value Proposition:** A complete shopping experience with realistic user flows, form validation, and state management—without backend complexity.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Background
Quality assurance teams and developers need realistic applications to test automation tools, validate testing frameworks, and practice e-commerce workflows. Many existing demo applications are either too simplistic (lacking real-world complexity) or too complex (requiring database setup and configuration).

### The Gap
There is a need for a demo e-commerce application that:
- Provides a complete end-to-end shopping experience
- Requires no backend infrastructure
- Contains realistic UI patterns and form validations
- Offers predictable behavior suitable for automated testing

### Solution
Storzy addresses this gap by providing a self-contained e-commerce frontend with all the essential shopping features, designed specifically for evaluating Felan's QA workflows and for general QA practice.
